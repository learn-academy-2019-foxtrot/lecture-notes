Create-React-App: gives us a huge file structure and all the dependencies we need to run a react application


- Show multiple classes in App.js
- Create a counter class
- Create a counter in state and render on the page
- Add one button
- Add one function
- setState
- onClick event
- destructure
- Then break them out into components: add exports, import to App.js, import React to all the components
